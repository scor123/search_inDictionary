# search_inDictionary script

this script for searching for a word in a file called "data.json", the file contains the meaning of words and when the user input a word, the program return its definition.
ideas about developing this script is building a web app where users enter the word and instead of using a json file, maybe searching different website and 
scraping the definition and display it on the screen
